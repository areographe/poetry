# I. 'A-E'
A little suckedness, a lot of suckedness.
a passionate following, a real vocalist you can enjoy
a severe shortcoming
a slight smokiness and is often utilised with a languorous tone
a thought on thought
ability to hit notes to convey emotion
absolutely fabulous voice
action and consequence
action and consequences
actions today make who i am tomorrow
aligning perceptions and behaviour creates satisfaction
all comes down to performance
architects of fate, who I have never heard of
authentic human empathy
best music examples
certainly not mainstream
character music
close to being pop
create a more resonant tone
damn good musicians
earthy authenticity
this guy’s voice
seems to crank out some good music
emotive and expressive voice
enlightened listening
enlightened music, enlightened music thoughts
even in business meetings

# II. 'F-L'
Fabulous resonance
following is rabidly passionate
genuine feelings
good music
good music is always good
Good pensive music
great listening songs
The great thing about Pandora is growing silver in my sideburns.
gut wrenching first words
have a sweetness and youthfulness that is not present in the lower extremes of the range.
if music is of any worth
I think the world would spontaneously combust.
I've gone so far in my travels, I'm starting to unravel
included an additional song
introspective and stark music
invested some valuable brain power on Miley Cyrus
What is a song?
it's simplicity.
knowing your musical shit
languid music
lesser known musicians
life lessons
live performances have been criticised for being pitchy
love it for its simplicity

III. 'M-P'
Makes you think
man is regretful
modern-life-is-quite-rubbish school of thought
more upbeat listening
mostly used in its warm and breathy timbre
music
music is a perfect example
music is a perfect example of how techno
music is fragile feeling and simplistically black & white
music should be able to speak for itself
music that has taken many years to create
music that makes you think
music that says listen to me
music worth a shit
musically a portrait of true sadness
no formula to capturing the soul of a follower group
Not all records should be played on
not many female singers could pull this off
not sure how to describe the songs
not sure how to describe them
often throw in some random songs
old white guy finding good music
one of the late 20something singers
or in a living room with a decent pot of earl grey
original versions are languid
overarching character that makes the voice easily identifiable
overproduce great feelings and thoughts
pensive music
pensive thoughtful music never goes out of style
phrasing and brilliant intonation
poignant songs
pretty much nothing I would enjoy listening to day in and day out;
probably the waves.

IV. 'Q-W'
quirky musicians
random songs
random songs when you set up playlists
remix can give a really good song
remix versions are
result isn't too perfect or polished
say too much about the music
showcases vulnerability
slightly understated techno vibe
So this is goodbye, Fitzsimmons
something to pick you up
sometimes quirky head gear
song collaboration is a little surprising
song doesn't even come close
song doesn't even come close to being pop
song I am glad I heard,
absolutely - beautiful & touching songwriting

Soul searching
soul searching for meaning
soul searching music
Soul searching type music

speaks for itself
spectacular voice in lower range
Stripping something down to its barest soul
sucker for a great pop hook
take longer for you to hear everything
taps into a heartbeat feeling
taps into your gut
techno rage has gone absurdly berserk
as will i be tomorrow
the song I am sharing:
the tender guitar opening
the truth is if music is of any worth
this guy’s voice
this song takes
this song takes the knife and twists it
thoughtful music
thoughtful songs
to have it click into place
tried to disguise progress
truth
truth is as if music
(a type of music)
versions are languid
voice has a clear and pure tone
Well-crafted, well-worded songs
What's wrong with an album that only works at 2 am?
while he's reassuring me that there are positive benefits to why everyone is complaining so much,
William Fitzimmons without the voice & variety
William Fitzsimmons
william fitzsimmons' pensive music
without ever truly experiencing an authentic engagement
without the interesting voice & variety.
